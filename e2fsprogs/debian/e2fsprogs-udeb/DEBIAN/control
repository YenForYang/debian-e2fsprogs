Description: stripped-down versions of e2fsprogs, for debian-installer
 This package is an e2fsprogs package built for a reduced size, so that
 it can help to save space in debian-installer.
 .
 Don't attempt to install this package, it has no support for a couple of
 features you surely want.  Anyway it should refuse to install.
